Q1
# Repeat worksheet #2 using awk to get the entire reviews that are verified or not. 
# Use awk to get the entire text of the verified and unverified reviews
# Redirect the "verified" true reviews to a file "verified.txt".
# Then put the unverified reviews in another file "unverified.txt" using redirection.

[vivian@sjsu ws8]$ awk -F "\t" '$12=="Y" {print $14}' ../amazon_reviews_us_Books_v1_02.tsv | head -n 100 > verified.txt

Q2
# Find the 10 most frequent words in the review_body of the verified reviews, then find the 10 most frequent 
# words in the review_body of the unverified reviews. Note: If this is taking too long for the entire dataset, 
# it is sufficient to do it just for 100 reviews so you get an idea.
